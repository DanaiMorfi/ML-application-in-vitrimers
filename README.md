Development and application of machine learning models for the prediction of critical properties of dynamically crosslinked polymers.

This GitHub contains all the code and excel files created and used during this work. 
Here, you can find all necessary information to better understand the workflow used, reproduce results or even build on the existing work and database and expand them to further research into this fascinating subject.

The logic behind the filing system is this: All files are numbered in a way that clearly indicates the order in which they should be used, along with their respective names. 
Because each code snippet is stored in its respective file, some documents (specifically excel files) need to be carefully copied and transferred from one file to the next in order for the next piece of code to work. Unifying all code snippets into one big code or arranging them in a single file was avoided, so as to keep everything as clean as possible. 

The basic functions behind every file will now be explained:
A. Excel files: Contains all excel files used and created during this work. This involves input excels like SMILES list excel, 
B. Coding files: Contains every piece of code used during this work, divided into steps.
B1. Feature extraction: 
B2. Pre processing:
B3. Dimensionality reduction:
B4. Model training:
B5. Plotting:
